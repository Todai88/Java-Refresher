### Chapter 3: Interfaces and Lambda expressions

#### Interfaces:

Interfaces can have default methods, much like abstract methods in Java. 
However, the main difference is that an abstract class can define a (or multiple) constructors and keeps a state.
An interface is more of a contract between the interface and any classes that `implements` the interface and can't hold any state.
